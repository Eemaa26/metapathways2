# Description of the data for the MetaPathways 2.0 data product

1. Sample_Name/preprocessed/   # the preprocessed folder
  Sample_Name.fasta   : the preprocessed fasta sequence after filtering the input sequences based
                        on the cutoffs on length, removal of ambiguous base pairs
  Sample_Name.mapping.txt   : the original names of the input sequences are mapped to produce 
                               uniform name in the format Sample_Name_x, where
                                  x is the contig number


2. Sample_Name/orf_prediction/:  this folder contains the output related to the prodigal
   Sample_Name.fna  :  Open Read Frame (ORFs) detected by prodigal
   Sample_Name.faa  :  the translated ORFs
   Sample_Name.gff  :  a gff file containing the ORF information by prodigal
   Sample_Name.qced.faa  : these are QCed amino acid sequences from file Sample_Name.faa after removing 
                           sequences that are too short. The names of the ORFs are in the format
                           Sample_Name_x_y, where 
                                x is the contig number and y is the ORF number in contig Sample_Name_x 
   Sample_Name.unannot.gff : These are created from the Sample_Name.gff file after removing the filtered sequences

3. Sample_Name/blast_results/:  this folder contains the BLAST or LAST results
    Sample_Name.dbname.LASTout :  tabular format of the LAST results of the Sample_Name.qced.faa file against the 
                                  database dbname
    Sample_Name.dbname.BLASTout : tabular format of the BLAST results of the Sample_Name.qced.faa file against the 
                                  database dbname
    Sample_Name.dbname.BLASTout.parsed.txt : tabular format of the parsed BLAST results of the Sample_Name.qced.faa file against the 
                                  database dbname
    Sample_Name.dbname.LASTout.parsed.txt : tabular format of the parsed LAST results of the Sample_Name.qced.faa file against the 
                                  database dbname

4. Sample_Name/genbank/:  this folder contains the annotatied and genbank files
   Sample_Name.annot.gff : The annotatated file created from Sample_Name.unannot.gff (folder 2 above )  by combining 
                           the annotations created from the parsed LAST/BLAST files 
   Sample_Name.gbk      : The genbank file created by putting the annotations into it

5. Sample_Name/mltreemap_calculations/: folder for the MLTreeMap result. Currently, it is empty


6. Sample_Name/ptools/:  this is the input to the pathway tools to create the PGDB

7. Sample_Name/results/: this is the results folder
   annotation_table  : folder that has the annotatation information tables
   megan : folder to drop the megan input file
   mltreemap : mltreemap summary results
   pgdb : the zipped PGDB file that needs to be unzipped in the ptools-local/pgdb/user/ folder
     Sample_Name.pathways.txt : provides the list of pathways in the column format 
                PWY_NAME   PWY_COMMON_NAME NUM_REACTIONS   NUM_COVERED_REACTIONS   ORF_COUNT
                note that at the end of each line (after the column ORF_COUNT) all the ORFs names are appended 
   rRNA : the rRNA scan stats file
   sequin : not used currently
   tRNA : the tRNA scan stats file

8 Sample_Name/run_statistics/: this folder has informatio about the run stats
   Sample_Name.amino.stats : the amino acid stats file before and after filtering the translated ORFs
   Sample_Name.contig.lengths.txt  : the contig length distribution file
   Sample_Name.nuc.stats : the nucleotide sequence stats file before and after filtering the translated ORFs
   Sample_Name.orf.lengths.txt : the ORF length stats file
   run_parameters.txt : this file stores the parameters  that were used for the run
